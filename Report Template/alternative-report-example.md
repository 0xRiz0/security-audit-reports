# About Shawn Rizo

I am a seasoned Smart Contract Engineer, adept at utilizing agile methodologies to deliver comprehensive insights and high-level overviews of blockchain projects. Specialized in developing and deploying decentralized applications (DApps) on Ethereum and EVM compatible chains. Expertise in Solidity, and security auditing, leading to a significant reduction in vulnerabilities through the strategic use of Foundry and Security Tools like Slither and Aderyn.

# Disclaimer

The Riiz0 team makes all effort to find as many vulnerabilities in the code in the given time period, but holds no responsibilities for the the findings provided in this document. A security audit by the team is not an endorsement of the underlying business or product. The audit was time-boxed and the review of the code was solely on the security aspects of the solidity implementation of the contracts.

# Risk Classification

|            |        | Impact |        |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | --- |
|            |        | High   | Medium | Low |
|            | High   | H      | H/M    | M   |
| Likelihood | Medium | H/M    | M      | M/L |
|            | Low    | M      | M/L    | L   |

We use the [CodeHawks](https://docs.codehawks.com/hawks-auditors/how-to-evaluate-a-finding-severity) severity matrix to determine severity. See the documentation for more details.
